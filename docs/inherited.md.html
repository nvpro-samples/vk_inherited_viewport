**Inherited Viewport Scissor Sample**

<small>by David Zhao Akeley</small>

This sample provides an example of how indirect draw commands and the
optional
[`VK_NV_inherited_viewport_scissor`
extension](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#VK_NV_inherited_viewport_scissor)
can be used to maximize secondary command buffer re-use. The indirect draw
commands allow a pre-recorded subpass secondary command buffer to deal with
varying model counts and positions, while the extension helps deal with
changing viewport sizes (due to the user resizing the window, etc.).
The extension is not required to run the sample; the sample can still be
used in this case as a simple example of secondary command buffer re-use.

# Introduction

In core Vulkan (at time of writing), secondary command buffers do not inherit
any state from the calling primary command buffer except for the active
render pass and subpass. This means that secondary command buffers must
set the dynamic viewport and scissor state themselves, and typically
must be re-recorded with new state when the window is resized, even
though all the other commands are unchanged. The extension provides
a way to avoid this inefficiency.


# Sample Background

!!! NOTE
    See `inherited.cpp`

Without the extension enabled, the sample is able to re-use a
secondary subpass command buffer only when the viewport that the
command buffer is meant to draw to has not been resized. A command
buffer is paired with the `VkViewport` state it was recorded with in
the `SubpassSecondary` struct. The `App::needNewSecondaryCmdBuf`
function detects when the secondary command buffer must be
re-recorded, which is when:

* The 2D viewport parameters don't match up with that of the target viewport.
  This is the case that the extension aims to eliminate.

* The `minDepth`/`maxDepth` bounds changed.

* The secondary command buffer has not yet been recorded in the first place.

!!! NOTE
    The scissor is deduced from the viewport, so the sample doesn't
    track stale scissor state. Most applications also don't vary the
    depth bounds dynamically and can skip the "depth bounds changed"
    check.

As each of the four viewports on screen needs different viewport/scissor
state, one secondary command buffer is needed for each one; they are
identical except for different `vkCmdSetViewport` and
`vkCmdSetScissor` commands. These secondary command buffers are stored
in `App::m_subpassSecondaryArray`.


# Extension

The extension defines the following extension structure for
`VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo`:

``` C
// Provided by VK_NV_inherited_viewport_scissor
typedef struct VkCommandBufferInheritanceViewportScissorInfoNV {
    VkStructureType      sType;
    const void*          pNext;
    VkBool32             viewportScissor2D;
    uint32_t             viewportDepthCount;
    const VkViewport*    pViewportDepths;
} VkCommandBufferInheritanceViewportScissorInfoNV;
```

If the extension structure is present with `viewportScissor2D` true,
then the restriction on inheriting viewport and scissor state is
relaxed. The
[spec](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#VkCommandBufferInheritanceViewportScissorInfoNV)
describes the requirements precisely, but basically, the viewport and
scissor state is that set by the most-recently executed viewport/scissor
setting command, subject to the restrictions:

* The viewport and scissor state is always undefined at the start of
  a primary command buffer, after a `vkCmdExecuteCommands`, and
  after binding a pipeline that defines the state statically.
  (This is all true in core Vulkan as well).

* The $i^{th}$ inherited viewport must have the same `minDepth` and
  `maxDepth` values as the $i^{th}$ entry of `pViewportDepths`, unless
  this viewport is not consumed by any draw commands. Thus useful
  inheritance is effectively limited to the 2D rectangle.

Additionally, secondary command buffers that enable viewport/scissor
inheritance are specifically forbidden from setting the inherited
state themselves.

!!! NOTE
    To be clear, the viewports in `pViewportDepths` are used only for their
    `minDepth` and `maxDepth` values; `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height`
    are ignored. We decided to re-use the `VkViewport` struct (rather than
    defining a new "depth only" viewport structure) as that allows more
    code reuse between the `VK_NV_inherited_viewport_scissor` code path
    and the fallback code path.


# Extension Integration

Start by checking if the extension is supported by checking for the
`VK_NV_INHERITED_VIEWPORT_SCISSOR_EXTENSION_NAME` string and placing a
`VkPhysicalDeviceInheritedViewportScissorFeaturesNV` structure on the
`pNext` chain of `VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2`, as usual.

To enable viewport/scissor inheritance for a secondary command buffer,
add a
[`VkCommandBufferInheritanceViewportScissorInfoNV`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkCommandBufferInheritanceViewportScissorInfoNV.html)
structure to the `pNext` chain of
[`VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo.html)
with `viewportScissor2D == VK_TRUE`. This is done in
`App::replaceSecondaryCmdBuf` in the sample.

``` C
    // The extension struct needed to enable inheriting 2D viewport+scisors.
    VkCommandBufferInheritanceViewportScissorInfoNV inheritViewportInfo {
        VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_COMMAND_BUFFER_INHERITANCE_VIEWPORT_SCISSOR_INFO_NV,
        nullptr,      // pNext
        VK_TRUE,      // viewportScissor2D
        1,            // viewportDepthCount
        &viewport     // pViewportDepths
    };
```

When this inheritance is done, we also must **not** set the viewport
and scissor state in the secondary command buffer, as would otherwise
usually be done.

The sample records the fact that this inheritance is enabled for the
command buffer in `SubpassSecondary::inheritViewportScissor`; if this is
true, there is no longer any need to match the target viewport's 2D size,
and we skip the matching-2D-rectangle check in `App::needNewSecondaryCmdBuf`.

!!! WARNING
    The depth range check must still remain, due to the
    `pViewportDepth`-matching requirement discussed earlier.

Finally, in `App::doFrame`, when viewport/scissor inheritance is enabled, we:

* Use only one secondary command buffer for all four viewports.

* Set the viewport and scissor state before each execution of the
  secondary command buffer, for the secondary command buffer to inherit.

The sample does this in the calling primary command buffer
(re-recorded every frame), but, it is also allowed to set the state in
an earlier secondary command buffer in the same `vkCmdExecuteCommands`
call.

That's about it. When the extension is supported, you can tap the `i`
key to toggle viewport/scissor inheritance. The sample logs when it
recreates the framebuffer or re-records the secondary command
buffer. You can see that when inheritance is disabled, both the
secondary command buffer and framebuffer are recreated every time the
window changes size, but when inheritance is enabled, only the
framebuffer is recreated upon window resize:
