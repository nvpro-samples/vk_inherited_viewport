**Inherited Viewport Scissor Sample**

<small>by David Zhao Akeley</small>

This article provides some info on how this sample is able to re-use its
subpass secondary command buffer.

# Indirect Draw

The fundamental feature that enables secondary command buffer re-use for
graphics is indirect drawing: draw commands that source their parameters
(`instanceCount`, ...) from a device buffer. This sample uses the command

``` C
void vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirect(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    VkBuffer                                    buffer,
    VkDeviceSize                                offset,
    uint32_t                                    drawCount,
    uint32_t                                    stride);
```

The parameters of this command together define the locations (within a device
buffer) of a sequence of `drawCount` `VkDrawIndexedIndirectCommand` structs:

``` C
typedef struct VkDrawIndexedIndirectCommand {
    uint32_t    indexCount;
    uint32_t    instanceCount;
    uint32_t    firstIndex;
    int32_t     vertexOffset;
    uint32_t    firstInstance;
} VkDrawIndexedIndirectCommand;
```

The behavior of the indirect drawing command will be as if the device
executed `drawCount`-many `vkCmdDrawIndexed` commands, with the parameters
for the $i^{th}$ draw coming from the identically-named members of the
$i^{th}$ `VkDrawIndexedIndirectCommand`.

For this sample, each `VkDrawIndexedIndirectCommand` corresponds to drawing
all instances of a certain model. The `indexCount`, `firstIndex`, and
`vertexOffset` defines the location within the bound vertex buffer for
the model definition, and `instanceCount` and `firstInstance` defines
the number and definitions of all instances of the model to draw.


# Static / Dynamic Data

Many graphics applications will sort data by their "hotness"; for this
sample, it's sufficient to sort data into that is constant throughout
the whole program (after its initial upload), and data that changes
each frame.

The unchanged data consists only of the models' definitions (vertices
and indices), all stored together in one shared vertex buffer:

``` C
// Data that doesn't change after upload to device.
struct StaticBufferData
{
  uint32_t   indices[MAX_INDICES];
  VertexData vertices[MAX_VERTICES];

  static constexpr VkIndexType indexType = VK_INDEX_TYPE_UINT32;
};

// In shaders/VertexData.h ...
struct VertexData
{
  #ifdef __cplusplus
    using vec4 = nvmath::vec4;
  #endif

  vec4 position;
  vec4 normal;   // w ignored.
  vec4 color;    // a is specular reflection brightness.

#ifdef __cplusplus
  static constexpr auto vec4format = VK_FORMAT_R32G32B32A32_SFLOAT;
  static std::array<VkVertexInputAttributeDescription, 3> getAttributes();
#endif
};
```

The per-frame data consists of the indirect commands from before
(which must change due to the changing `instanceCount` for each model),
the array of instances (model transformation matrices), and the UBO for
camera transformations (not really relevant to this discussion):

``` C
// Data that can change per-frame, stored in one buffer.
struct DynamicBufferData
{
  int unused;  // guard for offsetof mistakes

  // indirectCmds[i] holds info for drawing all instances of model i. Fill
  // unused entries with 0s. vertexOffset defines the location in
  // StaticBufferData::vertices that the model's verts are stored, and
  // firstIndex and indexCount defines the section in
  // StaticBufferData::indices.
  alignas(1024) VkDrawIndexedIndirectCommand indirectCmds[MAX_MODELS];

  // Array for storing instance data (model matrix, etc.)
  // Subsections are used for different models, defined by
  // indirectCmds[i].firstInstance and instanceCount.
  alignas(1024) InstanceData instances[MAX_INSTANCES];

  // Camera transformation matrices, bound as UBO.
  alignas(1024) CameraTransforms cameraTransforms;
};

// In shaders/InstanceData.h ...
struct InstanceData
{
  #ifdef __cplusplus
    using mat4 = nvmath::mat4;
  #endif

  mat4 modelMatrix;
};
```

The dynamic data will need to be re-uploaded from a staging buffer each frame.
This command can be put in a primary command buffer that is recorded once and
re-used.

``` C
class App
{
// ...

  // Command buffer and submit info for uploading DynamicBufferData
  // from the staging buffer to the device.
  VkCommandBuffer m_dynamicBufferUploadCmdBuffer{};
  VkSubmitInfo    m_dynamicBufferUploadSubmitInfo{};

    // ...

    // Record the DynamicBufferData staging->device copy command.
    m_dynamicBufferUploadCmdBuffer = m_frameManager.recordPrimaryCommandBuffer();
    m_buffers.cmdTransferDynamicStaging(
        m_dynamicBufferUploadCmdBuffer,
        VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_ALL_COMMANDS_BIT,
        VK_ACCESS_INDIRECT_COMMAND_READ_BIT
        | VK_ACCESS_VERTEX_ATTRIBUTE_READ_BIT
        | VK_ACCESS_UNIFORM_READ_BIT
        | VK_ACCESS_SHADER_READ_BIT);
    NVVK_CHECK(vkEndCommandBuffer(m_dynamicBufferUploadCmdBuffer));
    m_dynamicBufferUploadSubmitInfo = {
        VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_SUBMIT_INFO, nullptr, 0, nullptr, nullptr,
        1, &m_dynamicBufferUploadCmdBuffer, 0, nullptr };
```

where `cmdTransferDynamicStaging` is defined by

``` C
class ScopedBuffers
{
// ...
  nvvk::BufferDedicated    m_dynamicBuffer;
  nvvk::BufferDedicated    m_dynamicStaging;
  DynamicBufferData*       m_dynamicStagingPtr;

  // ...

  // Record a command for transferring dynamic buffer data from
  // staging to device. Includes barriers before and
  // after for the given stage and access flags.
  void cmdTransferDynamicStaging(VkCommandBuffer      cmdBuf,
                                 VkPipelineStageFlags stageFlags,
                                 VkAccessFlags        accessFlags) const
  {
    VkBufferMemoryBarrier beforeBarrier {
        VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_MEMORY_BARRIER,
        nullptr,
        accessFlags,
        VK_ACCESS_TRANSFER_WRITE_BIT,
        0, 0,
        m_dynamicBuffer.buffer,
        0, VK_WHOLE_SIZE };
    vkCmdPipelineBarrier(
        cmdBuf,
        stageFlags,
        VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TRANSFER_BIT,
        0, 0, nullptr, 1, &beforeBarrier, 0, nullptr);

    VkBufferCopy bufferCopy { 0, 0, sizeof(DynamicBufferData) };
    vkCmdCopyBuffer(cmdBuf, m_dynamicStaging.buffer, m_dynamicBuffer.buffer,
                    1, &bufferCopy);

    VkBufferMemoryBarrier afterBarrier {
        VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_MEMORY_BARRIER,
        nullptr,
        VK_ACCESS_TRANSFER_WRITE_BIT,
        accessFlags,
        0, 0,
        m_dynamicBuffer.buffer,
        0, VK_WHOLE_SIZE };
    vkCmdPipelineBarrier(
        cmdBuf,
        VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TRANSFER_BIT,
        stageFlags,
        0, 0, nullptr, 1, &afterBarrier, 0, nullptr);
  }
};
```

Note the necessity of `VK_ACCESS_INDIRECT_COMMAND_READ_BIT`.

The host program fills the dynamic staging buffer evey frame with the
latest instance and camera data; to avoid a data race, the application
must use a fence to ensure the previous frame's staging-to-device copy
finishes before overwriting the staging buffer with the current frame's
information.

``` C
  void doFrame()
  {
  // ...

    // Write new camera and instance data to staging buffer, then
    // copy to device. Note that a VkFence is used to synchronize host
    // and device access to staging buffer (see ScopedBuffers).
    VkFence dynamicStagingFence = m_buffers.getFence();
    vkWaitForFences(m_context, 1, &dynamicStagingFence, VK_TRUE, UINT64_MAX);
    DynamicBufferData* mapped = m_buffers.getDynamicStagingPtr();
    uncheckedUpdateDynamicStaging(mapped);

    // Start the upload of the data from the DynamicBufferData staging buffer.
    // Need the fence to ensure the transfer finishes before updating the
    // staging buffer in the next frame.
    vkResetFences(m_context, 1, &dynamicStagingFence);
    vkQueueSubmit(m_frameManager.getQueue(),
                  1, &m_dynamicBufferUploadSubmitInfo, m_buffers.getFence());
```

Most of details of `uncheckedUpdateDynamicStaging` and the example
animation that produces the instance data is out of the scope of this
article; however, be aware that a limitation of this strategy is the
fixed limit on the total number of models and instances that can be
supported.  There is a check in `tickAnimation` that prevents adding
additional instances if the `MAX_INSTANCES` limit is reached:

``` C
      if (modelData.instances.size() >= modelData.maxInstances)
      {
        if (!m_warnedTooManyInstances)
        {
          fprintf(stderr, "tickAnimation: reached maxInstances limit\n");
          m_warnedTooManyInstances = true;
        }
      }
      else
      {
        modelData.instances.push_back(instance);
      }
```

The static data also has to be initialized and copied to the device;
this is fairly straightforward so I'll omit the code for this (it's in
`App::fillStaticStagingInitDraws` and
`ScopedBuffers::cmdTransferStaticStaging`). Basically, we just have
to concatenate the vertex and index data for all models together
into `StaticBufferData`, and remember in `m_modelDraws` the subsections
in which each model was stored:

``` C
// Information needed to locate the vertices etc. of a model, plus its list of
// instances.
struct ModelDrawInfo
{
  // Model indices stored in this section of StaticBufferData::indices
  uint32_t firstIndex;
  uint32_t indexCount;

  // Vertex indices stored starting at this index in StaticBufferData::vertices
  int32_t vertexOffset;

  // Section of DynamicBufferData::instances reserved for this model's instances
  uint32_t firstInstance;
  uint32_t maxInstances;

  // List of instances. size() must be no more than maxInstances.
  std::vector<AnimatedInstanceData> instances; // NOTE: This is what tickAnimation modifies every frame.
};

// ...

class App
{
  // ...

  // Buffers and info on subsections allocated for each model.
  ScopedBuffers              m_buffers;
  std::vector<ModelDrawInfo> m_modelDraws;
```

!!! TIP Fast Object Deletion
    Another tip to take away from `tickAnimation` is fast removal from
    the middle of an `std::vector`. When the animation has to remove
    an instance from the middle of the instances array, instead of
    "filling the gap" by shifting over all subsequent instances
    ($O(n)$), it instead overwrites the gap with last instance in the array
    and then deletes the last instance from its original location.
    This only has $O(1)$ cost, and since depth testing is enabled,
    modifying the order that instances are drawn only causes an observable
    change in the very rare case when the depth test is tied for a fragment.


# Drawing

We now have to fill in the `VkDrawIndexedIndirectCommand` array and
record the indirect drawing command to the re-used secondary command
buffer:

``` C
class App
{
// ...

  VkCommandBuffer m_secondaryCmdBuf = VK_NULL_HANDLE;
```

## Primary Command Buffer

The sample defines a simple one-subpass render pass. The per-frame
`doFrame` function delegates recording render pass commands to
`cmdDrawFrame`; this starts mostly the same as what you'd expect, with
the notable change of using
`VK_SUBPASS_CONTENTS_SECONDARY_COMMAND_BUFFERS` because the actual
drawing commands will not be in the primary command buffer.

``` C
  // Record commands to primary command buffer. Just starts render
  // pass, set viewport/scissors, and call secondary command buffer.
  void cmdDrawFrame(VkCommandBuffer cmdBuf, VkFramebuffer framebuffer)
  {
    std::array<VkClearValue, 2> clearValues{};
    // ...

    VkRenderPassBeginInfo beginInfo {
        VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_RENDER_PASS_BEGIN_INFO,
        nullptr,
        m_renderPass,
        framebuffer,
        { { 0, 0 }, { width, height } }, // omitted width/height initialization
        uint32_t(clearValues.size()),
        clearValues.data() };

    // ... omitted viewport/scissor code (topic of main article).

    vkCmdBeginRenderPass(cmdBuf, &beginInfo,
                         VK_SUBPASS_CONTENTS_SECONDARY_COMMAND_BUFFERS);
```

We then execute the actual secondary command buffer (to be looked at shortly).

``` C
    vkCmdExecuteCommands(cmdBuf, 1, &m_secondaryCmdBuf);
```

I'd like to end the render pass now, but there's a slight complication
from the Dear ImGui interface, which also needs to record some drawing
commands.  Dear ImGui is a black box to me, so I don't try to reuse
its recorded commands; nevertheless, these commands have to be
recorded to a (temporary) secondary command buffer anyway, to match
`VK_SUBPASS_CONTENTS_SECONDARY_COMMAND_BUFFERS`.

``` C
    VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo inheritance {
        VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_COMMAND_BUFFER_INHERITANCE_INFO, nullptr,
        m_renderPass, 0 };
    VkCommandBuffer guiCmdBuf = m_frameManager.recordSecondaryCommandBuffer(
        VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_RENDER_PASS_CONTINUE_BIT, &inheritance);
    m_frameManager.freeFrameCommandBuffer(guiCmdBuf);
    ImGui_ImplVulkan_RenderDrawData(ImGui::GetDrawData(), guiCmdBuf);
    vkEndCommandBuffer(guiCmdBuf);
    vkCmdExecuteCommands(cmdBuf, 1, &guiCmdBuf);
```

Finally, the render pass can end.

``` C
    vkCmdEndRenderPass(cmdBuf);
```

!!! NOTE
    It would have been somewhat more efficient to execute both
    `m_secondaryCmdBuf` and `guiCmdBuf` in the same
    `vkCmdExecuteCommands`; however, I decided not to do this to avoid
    making the GUI code too distracting for an educational sample.


## Secondary Command Buffer

The `updateSecondaryCmdBuf` function fills `m_secondaryCmdBuf` with
the actual drawing commands. This is also fairly similar to what we'd
see if the drawing commands were in the primary command buffer, except
that there's (almost) no trace of the render pass instance.

We call this function in `doFrame`, just before recording the render
pass instance for the primary command buffer.

``` C
  // Body of main loop.
  void doFrame()
  {
  // ...

    // Select framebuffer for this frame.
    m_framebuffers.recreateNowIfNeeded(m_frameManager.getSwapChain());
    VkFramebuffer framebuffer = m_framebuffers[acquired.index];

    // Replace the secondary command buffer if it is no longer
    // suitable for use.
    updateSecondaryCmdBuf();

    // Record and submit primary command buffer, and present frame.
    // The primary command buffer is magically cleaned up.
    cmdDrawFrame(primaryCmdBuf, framebuffer);
  }
```

The function starts by checking if the secondary command buffer needs
to be re-recorded (topic of the main article); if so, allocate
a new secondary command buffer and schedule the old one for destruction.

``` C
  void updateSecondaryCmdBuf()
  {
    if (!needNewSecondaryCmdBuf()) return;

    // Get a new cmd buffer and throw away the old one.
    m_frameManager.freeFrameCommandBuffer(m_secondaryCmdBuf);
    m_secondaryCmdBuf = m_frameManager.allocateSecondaryCommandBuffer();
```

!!! NOTE
    The old secondary command buffer cannot just be re-recorded in-place
    as it may still be executing for the previous frame.

When recording a secondary command buffer for use in a subpass, the
`VkCommandBeginInfo` used to start recording must include a
`VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo` that specifies the render pass and
subpass it will be used in, along with the
`VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_RENDER_PASS_CONTINUE_BIT` flag. The
inheritance struct is also where the extension struct explained in the
main article is added.

``` C
    // Begin subpass.
    // The extension struct needed to enable inheriting 2D viewport+scisors.
    VkCommandBufferInheritanceViewportScissorInfoNV inheritViewportInfo {
        VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_COMMAND_BUFFER_INHERITANCE_VIEWPORT_SCISSOR_INFO_NV,
        nullptr,
        VK_TRUE,
        1, &m_viewport };

    // Typical inheritance info, add the extra extension if the user requests
    // it.
    uint32_t subpass = 0;
    VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo inheritance {
        VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_COMMAND_BUFFER_INHERITANCE_INFO,
        use_VK_NV_inherited_viewport_scissor ? &inheritViewportInfo : nullptr,
        m_renderPass, subpass };

    auto flags = VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_RENDER_PASS_CONTINUE_BIT
               | VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_SIMULTANEOUS_USE_BIT;
    VkCommandBufferBeginInfo beginInfo {
        VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_COMMAND_BUFFER_BEGIN_INFO,
        nullptr,
        VkCommandBufferUsageFlags(flags),
        &inheritance };
    NVVK_CHECK(vkBeginCommandBuffer(m_secondaryCmdBuf, &beginInfo));

```

We then have to set the dynamic viewport and scissor state; using the
extension to skip these commands is explained in the main article.

``` C
    // Set viewport and scissors (if not inherited).
    auto width  = uint32_t(m_viewport.width);
    auto height = uint32_t(m_viewport.height);
    // ...
    vkCmdSetViewport(m_secondaryCmdBuf, 0, 1, &m_viewport);
    VkRect2D scissor { { 0, 0 }, { width, height } };
    vkCmdSetScissor(m_secondaryCmdBuf, 0, 1, &scissor);
```

Except for the `vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirect`, the rest of the secondary
command buffer just consists of typical code for binding pipelines,
vertex buffers, and descriptor sets, and issuing draw calls.

``` C
    VkDescriptorSet descriptorSet = m_bufferDescriptors.getSet();

    // Draw background as full-screen triangle.
    vkCmdBindPipeline(m_secondaryCmdBuf, VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS,
                      m_backgroundPipeline);
    vkCmdBindDescriptorSets(
        m_secondaryCmdBuf,
        VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS,
        m_backgroundPipeline.getLayout(),
        0, 1, &descriptorSet, 0, nullptr);
    vkCmdDraw(m_secondaryCmdBuf, 3, 1, 0, 0);

    // Draw objects. Bind vertex and index buffer.  Draw indirect
    // allows us to vary the number of drawn objects without
    // re-recording this secondary command buffer.
    VkBuffer     vertexBuffer       = m_buffers.getStaticBuffer();
    VkDeviceSize vertexBufferOffset = offsetof(StaticBufferData, vertices);
    vkCmdBindVertexBuffers(
        m_secondaryCmdBuf,
        0, 1,
        &vertexBuffer, &vertexBufferOffset);
    vkCmdBindIndexBuffer(
        m_secondaryCmdBuf,
        m_buffers.getStaticBuffer(),
        offsetof(StaticBufferData, indices),
        StaticBufferData::indexType);
    vkCmdBindPipeline(
        m_secondaryCmdBuf, VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS, m_objectPipeline);
    vkCmdBindDescriptorSets(
        m_secondaryCmdBuf,
        VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS,
        m_objectPipeline.getLayout(),
        0, 1, &descriptorSet, 0, nullptr);
    vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirect(
        m_secondaryCmdBuf,
        m_buffers.getDynamicBuffer(),
        offsetof(DynamicBufferData, indirectCmds),
        MAX_MODELS,                            // NOTE: Length of array, see DynamicBufferData definition.
        sizeof(VkDrawIndexedIndirectCommand)); // NOTE: Tightly-packed VkDrawIndexedIndirectCommand array.
```

This concludes the secondary command buffer.

``` C
    NVVK_CHECK(vkEndCommandBuffer(m_secondaryCmdBuf));
```


## Indirect Draw Commands

The last piece of the puzzle is to make sure that the indirect draw
commands are correct when the secondary command buffer executes. The details
of the animation are again out-of-scope, but the gist is that
`m_modelDraws[i]` contains info for drawing the $i^{th}$ model, with
`m_modelDraws[i].instances` being the list of instances to draw.
So `uncheckedUpdateDynamicStaging` just has to translate this info
to a native Vulkan indirect draw command.

``` C
  // Write new values to dynamic staging buffer. No synchronization done.
  void uncheckedUpdateDynamicStaging(DynamicBufferData* mapped)
  {
    // Convert models into draw indexed indirect commands.
    for (size_t i = 0; i < m_modelDraws.size(); ++i)
    {
      mapped->indirectCmds[i].indexCount    = m_modelDraws[i].indexCount;
      mapped->indirectCmds[i].instanceCount =
          uint32_t(m_modelDraws[i].instances.size());
      mapped->indirectCmds[i].firstIndex    = m_modelDraws[i].firstIndex;
      mapped->indirectCmds[i].vertexOffset  = m_modelDraws[i].vertexOffset;
      mapped->indirectCmds[i].firstInstance = m_modelDraws[i].firstInstance;
    }
```

Recall that the staging buffer gets uploaded to the actual dynamic
data device buffer every frame, and that the memory barrier ensures
the later drawing command reads the up-to-date values.

Excess drawing commands get zero-initialized; this effectively turns
them into no-ops (note that unlike many "array size" parameters, there is
no requirement in Vulkan that any indexed draw parameters are non-zero).

``` C
    // Fill excess commands with 0s to avoid trouble.
    for (size_t i = m_modelDraws.size(); i < MAX_MODELS; ++i)
    {
      mapped->indirectCmds[i].indexCount    = 0;
      mapped->indirectCmds[i].instanceCount = 0;
      mapped->indirectCmds[i].firstIndex    = 0;
      mapped->indirectCmds[i].vertexOffset  = 0;
      mapped->indirectCmds[i].firstInstance = 0;
    }

    // ... omitted code for updating camera UBO and instances array.
```
